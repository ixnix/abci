# Aerosol-Biosphere-Climate Interactions Research Group

## About
The ABCI research group is located in the [Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences](https://www.mtu.edu/geo/), Michigan Technological University. The group has broad interests in the life cycle of atmospheric aerosols, their interactions with land-cover/land-use changes, and consequences on the ecosystems, air quality and climate. The group applies an integrated approach of remote sensing, in situ measurements, and statistical and physical models to study the mechcanisms, relationships, and impact of aerosol-biosphere-climate interactions.

## News
